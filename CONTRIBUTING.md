# Contributing to saslprep
Thank you for potentially contributing to saslprep. We have tried to set out a few guidelines below to help you, the author(s) and the maintainers.

# Bugs and Enhancements
We welcome new issue submissions identifying bugs and requested enhancements. We also welcome bug fixes and proposed code for enhancements. If you have found a security bug, please email the author or maintainer shown in the asd files directly rather than creating a new issue on github.

Please clearly describe the issue and test cases are very much appreciated. Proposed code changes and additions should, at a minimum, have a doc string for any new function or appropriate modification of existing doc string. We prefer that documentation also be added to the appropriate doc org file and tests using fiveam be added.

We also would appreciate it if you note which common lisp implementations and operating system you have used to test and ensure that your bugfix or enhancement actually works.

As a reminder - because we have done this ourselves - test that the new version can be compiled from a clean start (e.g. no debugging statements remain from a logging library).

We are always open to more tests, regardless of whether you have found a bug or need an enhancement.

# Code of Conduct
We have not had any historical issues with conduct related to saslprep, its users or contributors. That being said, we expect that people will behave with respect towards users or contributors. This is all volunteer work by everyone and while the range of experience and expertise varies widely, harrassment or insults do not add value to the code or the community and will not be tolerated.

# Licensing
All code is under the MIT license as set out in the LICENSE file found in the root directory. If you want to contribute existing code which has another license, you need to get permission from that licensor to have the code released under the same rules as the rest of saslprep or work with the maintainer(s) for appropriate licensing.

# Questions
Feel free to email the current author or maintainer as shown in the asd files if you want to address something off line.
