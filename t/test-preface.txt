# Normalization Test Suite
# Format:
#
#   Columns (c1, c2,...) are separated by semicolons
#   They have the following meaning:
#      source; NFC; NFD; NFKC; NFKD
#   Comments are indicated with hash marks
#   Each of the columns may have one or more code points.
#
# CONFORMANCE:
# 1. The following invariants must be true for all conformant implementations
#
#    NFC
#      c2 ==  toNFC(c1) ==  toNFC(c2) ==  toNFC(c3)
#      c4 ==  toNFC(c4) ==  toNFC(c5)
#
#    NFD
#      c3 ==  toNFD(c1) ==  toNFD(c2) ==  toNFD(c3)
#      c5 ==  toNFD(c4) ==  toNFD(c5)
#
#    NFKC
#      c4 == toNFKC(c1) == toNFKC(c2) == toNFKC(c3) == toNFKC(c4) == toNFKC(c5)
#
#    NFKD
#      c5 == toNFKD(c1) == toNFKD(c2) == toNFKD(c3) == toNFKD(c4) == toNFKD(c5)
#
# 2. For every code point X assigned in this version of Unicode that is not specifically
#    listed in Part 1, the following invariants must be true for all conformant
#    implementations:
#
#      X == toNFC(X) == toNFD(X) == toNFKC(X) == toNFKD(X)
#
@Part0 # Specific cases
#
@Part1 # Character by character test
# All characters not explicitly occurring in c1 of Part 1 have identical NFC, D, KC, KD forms.
#
@Part2 # Canonical Order Test
#
@Part3 # PRI #29 Test
